# 😰 Stress Detection from Facial Expressions (Machine Learning + Django)

This project detects whether a person is stressed or not by analyzing their face image. It uses a machine learning model trained on facial expressions and is built with **Python** and **Django**. Users can upload an image, and the model will tell if the person is "Stressed" or "Not Stressed".

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Predicts stress based on face expressions
- 📸 Upload image from your device
- 💻 Built with Django web framework
- ⚙️ Machine Learning model trained with TensorFlow/Keras
- 🖼️ Uses OpenCV to detect faces from images

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User uploads a face image on the website
2. The system detects the face using OpenCV
3. The machine learning model checks the face and predicts:
   - ✅ Not Stressed  
   - ❌ Stressed
4. The result is shown on the webpage
